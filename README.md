Starling is a high-level programming language designed for data processing.

# Requirements
## Python (Prototyping) Implementation:
* Python 3
* llvmlite

## Zig Implementation:
* Zig
* LLVM

# Roadmap
## Bootstrap
This will likely be done only in Python as a simple starting point.

- [x] Prototype grammar
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] Basic codegen (maybe just an interpreter)

## Initial Design
- [ ] Create language design goals
- [ ] Determine necessary features and main focuses
- [ ] Begin language grammar
- [ ] Implement new grammar features into lexer and parser
- [ ] Codegen framework and support for different backends (compiled/interpreted)
- [ ] Zig implementation
